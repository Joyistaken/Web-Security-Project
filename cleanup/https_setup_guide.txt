HTTPS SETUP FOR YOUR DOMAINS

I've set up HTTPS for both your domains. Here's what I did:

1. Enabled Apache SSL modules:
   - Added LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
   - Added LoadModule socache_shmcb_module modules/mod_socache_shmcb.so

2. Added SSL configuration inclusion:
   - Added Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf to httpd.conf

3. Added Listen 443 directive to enable HTTPS port

4. Created SSL virtual hosts for both domains:
   - https://project.localhost.com
   - https://websec.local.com

STEPS TO COMPLETE THE SETUP:

1. XAMPP comes with a self-signed certificate, but if you want to create a new one:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Run the following commands:
     cd C:\xampp\apache\bin
     openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ..\conf\ssl.key\server.key -out ..\conf\ssl.crt\server.crt

2. Restart Apache from XAMPP Control Panel:
   - Stop Apache
   - Start Apache

3. Access your sites using HTTPS:
   - https://project.localhost.com
   - https://websec.local.com

NOTE: Since you're using self-signed certificates, your browser will show a security warning. 
This is normal for local development. You can:
- Click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to site" (Chrome)
- Click "Accept the Risk and Continue" (Firefox)
- Or add a security exception in your browser

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If Apache fails to start:
1. Check the Apache error log in XAMPP
2. Make sure port 443 is not in use by another application
3. Verify that the SSL certificate and key files exist:
   - C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.crt\server.crt
   - C:\xampp\apache\conf\ssl.key\server.key
