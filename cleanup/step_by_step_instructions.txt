COMPLETE STEPS TO FIX DOMAIN ISSUES:

1. COPY THE CORRECT VHOSTS CONFIGURATION:
   - Copy the contents of "fixed_vhosts.conf" 
   - Open Notepad as Administrator
   - Open C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf
   - Delete all content and paste the new configuration
   - Save the file

2. VERIFY HTTPD.CONF INCLUDES VHOSTS:
   - Open C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf
   - Make sure this line is NOT commented out (no # at the beginning):
     Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
   - If it's commented out, remove the # and save

3. UPDATE HOSTS FILE CORRECTLY:
   - Follow instructions in hosts_file_update.txt
   - This is critical for local domain resolution

4. RESTART APACHE PROPERLY:
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel as Administrator
   - Stop Apache if running
   - Click Start

5. FLUSH DNS CACHE:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Run: ipconfig /flushdns
   - Restart your browser

6. TEST BOTH DOMAINS:
   - Try accessing: http://project.localhost.com
   - Try accessing: http://websec.local.com
   
7. IF STILL NOT WORKING:
   - Try restarting your computer
   - Temporarily disable firewall/antivirus
   - Check if Apache is actually running (green light in XAMPP)
   - Check Apache error logs
