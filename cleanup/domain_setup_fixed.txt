UPDATED DOMAIN SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

I've fixed the Apache configuration for your two domains:

1. project.localhost.com
   - Points to: C:/Users/esam3/Downloads/websec-main/web/public
   - Main project domain

2. websec.local.com
   - Points to: C:/xampp/apache/conf/ssl/websec/public
   - Secondary project domain

WHAT'S BEEN FIXED:

1. Removed CustomLog directive that was causing syntax errors
2. Simplified the virtual host configuration
3. Verified the configuration syntax

HOW TO START APACHE:

Option 1: XAMPP Control Panel
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Click Start for Apache

Option 2: Command Line (as administrator)
   - Run the included start_apache.bat file
   - Or open command prompt as administrator and run: C:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe

REMINDER - UPDATE HOSTS FILE:

Make sure to update your hosts file with:
127.0.0.1 project.localhost.com
127.0.0.1 websec.local.com

ACCESS YOUR SITES:
- http://project.localhost.com
- http://websec.local.com

TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. Make sure Apache is running
2. Verify hosts file was updated correctly
3. Try clearing your browser cache
4. Check error logs in C:\xampp\apache\logs
