UPDATED ACCESS INSTRUCTIONS

I found the issue! Apache is running on port 8080, not port 80.

1. I've updated the VirtualHost configurations to use port 8080

2. You need to access your sites using:
   - http://project.localhost.com:8080
   - http://websec.local.com:8080

3. Make sure your hosts file has these entries:
   127.0.0.1 localhost
   127.0.0.1 project.localhost.com
   127.0.0.1 websec.local.com

4. Restart Apache in XAMPP Control Panel

5. Run this command to flush DNS cache:
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Run: ipconfig /flushdns

6. Important: Close and reopen your browser before testing
