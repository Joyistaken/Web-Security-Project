Instructions for updating your hosts file:

1. Open Notepad as administrator (right-click on Notepad in Start menu and select "Run as administrator")
2. Open the file: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
3. Add these lines at the end of the file:

127.0.0.1 project.localhost.com
127.0.0.1 websec.local.com

4. Save the file and close Notepad
5. Start XAMPP Control Panel as administrator
6. Click "Start" for Apache

After these changes, access your sites at:
http://project.localhost.com:8080
http://websec.local.com:8080

Note: We've changed Apache to use port 8080 instead of 80 to avoid conflicts.
