APACHE CONFIGURATION GUIDE
=======================

We've fixed your Apache configuration to work with simple HTTP (port 8080). Here's what we did:

1. Created a simplified httpd.conf with minimal modules
2. Set up virtual hosts for your domains on port 8080:
   - http://project.localhost.com:8080
   - http://websec.local.com:8080

To make everything work:

1. ADD THESE ENTRIES TO YOUR HOSTS FILE (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts):
   127.0.0.1 project.localhost.com
   127.0.0.1 websec.local.com

2. RUN THE RESTART SCRIPT:
   Double-click the "restart_apache.bat" file we created

3. ACCESS YOUR SITES:
   - http://project.localhost.com:8080
   - http://websec.local.com:8080

If you still want to enable HTTPS later, please follow these steps once the HTTP version is working:

1. Create self-signed certificates
2. Enable the SSL module in Apache
3. Configure SSL virtual hosts

For now, let's make sure the basic HTTP configuration works first.

TROUBLESHOOTING
==============
- If Apache won't start, check the error log at C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log
- Make sure port 8080 is not in use by another application
- Ensure you have the correct file permissions on your web directories
