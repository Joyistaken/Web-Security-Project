DOMAIN SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

I've set up two separate domains for your projects:

1. project.localhost.com
   - Points to: C:/Users/esam3/Downloads/websec-main/web/public
   - Main project domain

2. websec.local.com
   - Points to: C:/xampp/apache/conf/ssl/websec/public
   - Secondary project domain

WHAT I'VE DONE:

1. Created and installed virtual host configuration
   - File: C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf
   - Configured both domains with separate document roots

2. Updated Apache configuration
   - Added virtual hosts inclusion to httpd.conf
   - Ensured proper configuration

3. Created test index.php files
   - One for each domain to verify they're working

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

1. Update your hosts file:
   - Follow the instructions in hosts_update_instructions.txt
   - This maps the domain names to your localhost

2. Restart Apache:
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Stop Apache if running
   - Start Apache again

3. Test both domains:
   - Open your browser and visit:
     * http://project.localhost.com
     * http://websec.local.com
   - You should see different content on each site

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If domains don't work:
1. Make sure Apache is running
2. Verify hosts file was updated correctly
3. Try clearing your browser cache
4. Check Apache error logs in XAMPP Control Panel

All configuration files are backed up in case you need to revert changes.
